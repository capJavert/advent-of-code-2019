# Advent of Code 2019

### Update #1: It's that time of the year again.. So let's go!!
### Update #2: Day 6 is the first one where I struggled a little bit.. refreshed my tree traversal and manipulation knowledge.. Now I am ready for future tree based problems :relaxed:
### Update #3: I overcomplicated day 7 for no good reason. Solved part one really fast but then part 2 description was a bit confusing. After reading again I also made a mistake of giving same object ref to every amplifier.. which resulted in them sharing state instead of each one having its own.. after debugging that the program worked and part 2 was solved!
